1) mutable keyword causes everything to go wrong
    Done F
2) using pycharm to write functions
    Done C
4) explicit function signatures
    ??
5) Testing (not pytest).
    a) interpreting error messages (code that makes an error - make them fix it), b) writing test code where you generate input, give it to a function and look at output and saving the test code (will be used later in course). Maybe have a function where you divide by a variable (so div by zero will cause issues).
    Done F
    C: Try to find good error stacks. Done
6) Why split functions between files.
   Why more than one function per file? - introduce the idea of modularity.
   C
3) extracting functions to modules - importing them (using pycharm)
    Finish: C
4)  return/yield
    Done F
5) pass function to another function, or assign a function to a variable
   F
